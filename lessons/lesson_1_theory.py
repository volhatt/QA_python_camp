### 1 Boolean operators
"""
Boolean logic is named after George Boole, who developed a whole system of mathematics based on two values, called true
 and false, and the operations on themâ€”AND, OR, and NOT.
"""

### 2. Dictionary, methods
"""
Method      Parameters  Description
keys        none        Returns a view of the keys in the dictionary
values      none        Returns a view of the values in the dictionary
items       none        Returns a view of the key-value pairs in the dictionary
get         key         Returns the value associated with key; None otherwise
get         key,alt     Returns the value associated with key; alt otherwise
